App: Crop Sense
Name: Scott McLeod
New Tech: React-Bootstrap-Table or maybe D3.js. I need to look more at D3.

1. I plan on learning/implementing the new technology by going through the docs and examples. I will watch tutorials if necessary. I want the data to be displayed in an easy to read and meaningful way.
2. My goal with this project is to create an app where the user would have the ability to enter data for care of their farm/garden/yard in order to be able to monitor progress and develop future care plans.
3. The user for my app could be anyone ranging from a backyard gardener to a farmer. Anyone who would like to be able to have data points to track progress.
4. Potential roadblocks that I can currently see include still not being super comfortable with React, and also finding a way in which to display the information I plan on displaying in a way that clearly shows a correlation between care and progress.
